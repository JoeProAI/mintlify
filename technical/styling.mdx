# Styling Guide

VitalMatrix uses a combination of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS for styling components. This document outlines our styling approach and dark mode implementation.

## CSS Architecture

We follow a hybrid approach to styling:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-based styling of components
- **Component CSS**: For complex components with specific styling needs
- **Global CSS**: For app-wide styles and theme definitions

## Dark Mode Implementation

VitalMatrix supports both light and dark modes with a user preference system.

### Dark Mode Strategy

1. **Separate CSS Files**: We maintain dedicated dark mode CSS files (e.g., `nutrilens-dark-v2.css`) for feature-specific styling
2. **Cache Busting**: Versioned CSS file names ensure style updates are applied without caching issues
3. **!important Flags**: Used strategically to override default styles in dark mode
4. **Media Queries**: Support for system preference via `prefers-color-scheme`

### NutriLens Dark Mode

The NutriLens component has received a comprehensive dark mode update:

```css
/* Example of NutriLens dark mode styling */
.camera-container {
  background-color: #121212 !important;
  border: 1px solid #333 !important;
}

.scanning-indicator {
  background-color: rgba(0, 150, 136, 0.7) !important;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 150, 136, 0.5) !important;
}
```

### Implementation Details

- **Dynamic Import**: Dark mode CSS is imported in `_app.tsx`
- **Class-Based Toggle**: Dark mode is toggled via a `dark-mode` class on the root element
- **CSS Variables**: Theme colors are defined as CSS variables for easy customization
- **Contrast Checking**: All color combinations are tested for WCAG AA compliance

## Best Practices

1. **Component Isolation**: Keep component styles isolated to prevent leakage
2. **Responsive Design**: All components should be responsive across devices
3. **Accessibility**: Maintain proper contrast ratios and focus states
4. **Consistent Naming**: Follow BEM-inspired naming conventions for custom classes
5. **Minimal Specificity**: Keep selector specificity as low as possible

## Recent Improvements

- Added separate dark mode CSS file with cache busting
- Improved contrast ratios for better accessibility
- Reduced animation effects for better performance
- Implemented subtle design cues for camera and scanning status
- Replaced neon/glassmorphism effects with more subtle indicators
