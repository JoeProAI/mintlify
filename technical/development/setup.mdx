# Development Setup

This guide covers the detailed development environment setup for VitalMatrix contributors.

## Development Environment

### Recommended Tools

- **VSCode**: Configured with our recommended extensions
- **Node.js**: v16.x or later (v18.x preferred)
- **Git**: With commit signing configured
- **Browser DevTools**: Chrome or Firefox with React DevTools extension

### IDE Configuration

We recommend VSCode with these extensions:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- TypeScript Hero
- Jest Runner

Our repository includes VSCode settings in `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent formatting and linting.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

First, fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vitalmatrix.git
cd vitalmatrix
```

### 2. Set Up Upstream Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vitalmatrix/vitalmatrix.git
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Create Local Environment

Copy the example environment file and modify as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### 5. Initialize Development Database

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing

Run unit and integration tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Linting and Code Quality

Format your code:

```bash
npm run format
```

Lint your code:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Type check your code:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

## Working with Feature Branches

Create a new branch for your feature:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Update your branch with upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. Verify your changes pass all checks:
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

3. Push your branch and create a pull request

## Local API Mocking

For frontend development without backend dependencies:

```bash
npm run mock-api
```

This starts a local mock API server at `http://localhost:3001/api`.

## Database Management

Access the development database:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Reset the development database:

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**: Change the port in `.env.local` if 3000 is already in use
2. **Dependency Issues**: Try `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for clean installs
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npm run clean` to clear TypeScript cache

### Development Logs

Enable enhanced logging during development:

```
DEBUG=vitalmatrix:* npm run dev
```
