# Using NutriLens

This guide covers how to use the NutriLens feature in your application.

## Component Integration

To integrate NutriLens into your React application:

```tsx
import NutriLensPage from '../features/NutriLens/NutriLensPage';

// In your component
return (
  <div>
    <NutriLensPage />
  </div>
);
```

## Camera Permissions

NutriLens requires camera permissions to function. The component will automatically request these permissions when initialized. For security reasons, camera access requires:

- HTTPS connection (or localhost for development)
- User permission grant via browser prompt
- Compatible device with camera access

## Barcode Scanning

NutriLens includes real-time barcode scanning functionality:

1. The scanning process starts automatically when the camera is active
2. Position a barcode within the camera view
3. Hold the barcode steady until it's recognized
4. View the nutritional information once the barcode is successfully scanned

The component uses interval-based scanning to balance performance and accuracy. The interval is customizable through props.

## Image Capture

To capture and analyze a food image:

1. Position the food item in the center of the camera view
2. Tap the capture button to take a photo
3. The image will be analyzed automatically
4. View the detected food items and their nutritional information

## Image Upload

To analyze an existing image:

1. Tap the upload button to open the file selector
2. Select an image from your device
3. The image will be analyzed automatically
4. View the detected food items and their nutritional information

## Error Handling

NutriLens includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Camera permission denials
- Device compatibility issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Barcode recognition failures
- Image analysis failures

Error messages are displayed to the user with helpful instructions on how to resolve common issues.

## Debugging Mode

NutriLens includes a debugging mode that can be enabled for development and troubleshooting:

```tsx
<NutriLensPage debugMode={true} />
```

When debug mode is active, additional information is displayed on screen and logged to the console.
